# can-i-have-a-dog
Here I am trying to build a mobile application to simulate the challenges in the real world faced by having a dog, so that kids can actually get practical ideas about whether they could have a dog. 

This is sparked by a conversion today with Christa, my 10 years old daughter who is determined to become a biologist at this stage. She has always wanted a dog. However, due to family circumstances, we haven't being able to adopt one yet. We are planning to have one maybe next year.

When we talked about the responsibilities of having a dog, Christa was proudly telling me that she has done some hard work walking a dog from house to the park in "Roblox". I was amused. How hard could it be walking a dog in a computer? It should be no where near the challenge of walking a dog along the muddy road during a heavy the rain, which I have seen people doing, even with rain coat on the dogs. Then this idea came to me.

We should be able to build an application on the mobile so that kids can really take them out for a walk. If they have not been walked enough, they should just bark and prevent the young owners from doing anything else on the phone or tablet :). Of cause, you also need to feed, bath, pot train them etc as a real dog. You can set up a family accounts for relatives to help you with the work. During the walking, if getting close to another virtual dog, they can bark as well so you can share a friendly nod :).

I am a full stack engineer but don't have much experience in building mobile apps. I am planning to use flutter and LLM to help me build a prototype as an experiment but I guess it might take quite a while for me to get something working.

If you think this might be a good idea, please feel free to join.
